# Semester 3 - CESAR School
A quick summary of all topics covered throughout the semester.


## Software Infrastructure
General objective:
To present the concepts, abstractions, fundamentals, mechanisms, and implementations of modern Operating Systems, analyzing the main components and exploring some advanced topics.

Specific objectives:
Understand the operation and algorithms of an operating system;
